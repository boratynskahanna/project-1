    <p>I couldn't get nowhere, wouldn't get growing<br>
    My eyes just wouldn't show me just where I'm going<br>
    I was blinded with you here, baby<br>
    Trying to find what isn't there, girl<br>
    Girl, I didn't give you heart<br>
    Because I didn't think you were my right love<br>
    Oh, I tried girl<br>
    Girl, I didn't give you more<br>
    Because I didn't think you were my right love<br>
    Oh, I tried girl<br>
    I found me when you left, baby<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found freedom when you left, darling<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found me when you left, baby<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found freedom when you left, darling<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    Girl, why was I fighting? Why was I trying?<br>
    I searched, I couldn't find it, no I couldn't find it<br>
    I was blinded with you here, baby<br>
    Trying to find what isn't there, darling<br>
    I found me when you left, baby<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found freedom when you left, darling<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found me when you left, baby<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found freedom when you left, darling<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    Ooh, I had love for you<br>
    Ooh, baby I tried<br>
    Ooh, I had love for you<br>
    Ooh, I did try<br>
    I found me when you left, baby<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found freedom when you left, darling<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found me when you left, baby<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    I found freedom when you left, darling<br>
    I felt free with you gone<br>
    Ooh, baby I would<br>
    Ooh, baby I did try<br>
    Ooh, still here for you<br>
    Ooh, yeah I did try.</p>
